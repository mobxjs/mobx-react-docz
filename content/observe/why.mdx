# Why to observe?

MobX is based on concept of **observables** which may feel like magical tiny boxes (_as everything unknown_), but it's fairly simple actually.

If you have ever worked with [PubSub-like patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) (eg. _EventEmitter_), the observable it's fairly similar concept, but wrapped into a fancy package.

✨ It will manage subscriptions automatically while you focus on declaring what data you need.

⏱ It's time-proof. You will always get a latest value no matter when you start observing.

<p>
  This is very useful in the React world as you can stick to a declarative way
  of writing components and simply work with data without additional hurdles and
  boilerplate.

```tsx
function LogoutWidget() {
  const { user } = useStore()
  return useObserver(() => (
    <Link to="/logout">
      <span className="name">{user.name}</span>
    </Link>
  ))
}
```

In a usual React paradigms (eg. useReducer) such a component cannot re-render itself based on change of `user.name`. The parent component needs to cause an update to child component and that's not very efficient.

With observer in place, component itself can be notified about the change (as long as `user` is observable) and do a re-render without a parent ever knowing about it.
