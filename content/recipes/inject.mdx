# Store injecting

The store injection pattern was popularized by the `mobx-react` library. It refers to a now obsolete way of accessing the MobX stores across the component tree. It was introduced was because the React [legacy context](https://reactjs.org/docs/legacy-context.html) was rather awkward to use.

We are in 2019 now and we don't need injections anymore (_kids, don't do drugs_).

## Why is it obsolete?

The main reason is that we have much better tools at our disposal now. The inject pattern is not wrong or broken in general, but it is rather limited and error-prone.

In its simplest form `inject('myStore')` _(strings, meh!)_ the wrapped component props get modified and it is easy to lose track of what is coming into the component because the string argument does not give you any clue. This can be a source of annoying bugs, and maybe more importantly the pattern is incompatible with a typed language like Typescript. You can read more about the struggles with Typescript in this [unresolved issue](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react/issues/256).

An alternative variant of inject allows for reactive selections over the stores to pick the values that the component requires. It can be useful if reused over multiple components, but otherwise it brings similar confusion as the simple form of inject.

```tsx
const NameDisplayer = ({ name }) => <h1>{name}</h1>

const UserNameDisplayer = inject(stores => ({
  name: stores.userStore.name,
}))(NameDisplayer)

const App = () => <UserNameDisplayer name="Is this name used? Who knows." />
```
