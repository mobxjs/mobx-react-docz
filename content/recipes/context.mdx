# React Context

If you are using `inject` in your code, please refer to the [migration guide](/recipes-migration) first, or learn [why inject is considered obsolete](/recipes-inject).

[React Context][context] replaces the [Legacy context][context-legacy] which was fairly awkward to use.

Let's make a small, but not-so-contrived example to show what this means for MobX.

### Create store

Let's declare a simple store. No need to worry about observables at this point, it's just a plain object.

```tsx
export type TFriend = {
  name: string
  isFavorite: boolean
  isSingle: boolean
}

export function createStore() {
  // note the use of this which refers to observable instance of the store
  return {
    friends: [] as TFriend[],
    makeFriend(name, isFavorite = false, isSingle = false) {
      const oldFriend = this.friends.find(friend => friend.name === name)
      if (oldFriend) {
        oldFriend.isFavorite = isFavorite
        oldFriend.isSingle = isSingle
      } else {
        this.friends.push({ name, isFavorite, isSingle })
      }
    },
    get singleFriends() {
      return this.friends.filter(friend => friend.isSingle)
    },
  }
}

export type TStore = ReturnType<typeof createStore>
```

> For TypeScript user it's important to note that `this` will work correctly only when `noImplicitThis` or `strict` option is enabled in `tsconfig.json`.

### Setup context

Nothing spectacular about it really, better to read [React docs][context] if you are unsure though.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { createStore, TStore } from './createStore'
import { useLocalStore } from 'mobx-react' // 6.x or mobx-react-lite@1.4.0

const storeContext = React.createContext<TStore | null>(null)

export const StoreProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const store = useLocalStore(createStore)
  return <storeContext.Provider value={store}>{children}</storeContext.Provider>
}

export const useStore = () => {
  const store = React.useContext(storeContext)
  if (!store) {
    // this is especially useful in TypeScript so you don't need to be checking for null all the time
    throw new Error('useStore must be used within a StoreProvider.')
  }
  return store
}
```

> You could drop the whole Provider dance and set created store as a default value of the `createContext`. The reference of the store object does not need to change, so it will work in most cases. However, you might still setup a Provider for tests to battle flakiness.

### Making friends

Now somewhere in the tree we have a component like this.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useStore } from '../../../store'

export const FriendsMaker = observer(() => {
  const store = useStore()
  const onSubmit = ({ name, favorite, single }) =>
    store.makeFriend(name, favorite, single)

  return (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      Total friends: {store.friends.length}
      <input type="text" id="name" />
      <input type="checkbox" id="favorite" />
      <input type="checkbox" id="single" />
    </form>
  )
})
```

_Explicit implementation of form logic would take up too much space and is not important for the show case._

### Listing friends

In some other part of the app we want to show friends that are single and favorite.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useStore } from '../../../../store'

export const MatchMaker = observer(() => {
  const store = useStore()
  // for a sake of example filtering is done here
  // you might as well expose it on the store directly
  const singleAndFavoriteFriends = store.singleFriends.filter(
    friend => friend.isFavorite,
  )
  return <div>{singleAndFavoriteFriends.map(renderFriend)}</div>
})
```

## Complex stores

The example above is still very contrived. Usually the app state is much more robust, but it does not differ that much in its essence. You can have a single Root store and attach every other store onto it. Or have a multiple contexts, each for own segment of the app.

Perhaps you want to consider [mobx-state-tree] for declaring store shape? It comes with other powerful features like snapshots and type safety out of box. Be sure to check it out.

The power of React hooks allows you to create specific hooks for abstracting how is the store structured, eg. `useFriendsList` or `useOrderCart`.

Such hooks are also great for mitigating long paths in a bigger folder structure as seen in the examples above.

## Multiple global stores

In your application, you might need to have multiple global stores in order to better separate your different concerns.
Example stores could be, `CurrentUserStore`, `ShoppingCartStore`, `UserThemeStore`, etc. With the use of React Context and Hooks,
we can make this pretty simple and scalable.

In this section, we'll make a custom hook called `useStores` that we can use to destructure the store or stores that we need within our given application components.

Our example application will have two stores, `CounterStore` and `ThemeStore`.

```tsx
// src/stores/counter-store.tsx
import { observable, action, computed } from 'mobx'

export class CounterStore {
  @observable
  count = 0

  @action
  increment() {
    this.count++
  }

  @action
  decrement() {
    this.count--
  }

  @computed
  get doubleCount() {
    return this.count * 2
  }
}
```

```tsx
// src/stores/theme-store.tsx
import { observable, action } from 'mobx'

export class ThemeStore {
  @observable
  theme = 'light'

  @action
  setTheme(newTheme: string) {
    this.theme = newTheme
  }
}
```

It's important to note that we are only exporting the store classes themselves here, and not instances of them. It is considered a bad practice to keep stores globally as it will cause issues when managing unit and integrations tests in a non-trivial application.

Next we want to make a `storesContext` that will contain each of our stores.

```tsx
// src/contexts/index.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { CounterStore, ThemeStore } from '../stores'

export const storesContext = React.createContext({
  counterStore: new CounterStore(),
  themeStore: new ThemeStore(),
})
```

Here we are simply instantiating the classes directly, but another viable pattern is to create factory functions for each store, like `createCounterStore()` which hides the fact the store is a class and makes it easier to implement `React.useState(createCounterStore)` if such a need arises. Either approach allows for overriding your stores within tests.

In a complex app where stores might share dependencies, you might have to defer the instantiation of a store after some initialization is complete, in this case, the `Provider` is necessary.

Finally, let's make our custom `useStores` hook to access the exported `storesContext` value.

```tsx
// src/hooks/use-stores.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { storesContext } from '../contexts'

export const useStores = () => React.useContext(storesContext)
```

Now we're ready to start consuming and using our stores.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { observer } from 'mobx-react'
import { useStores } from '../hooks/use-stores'

// src/components/Counter.tsx
export const Counter = observer(() => {
  const { counterStore } = useStores()

  return (
    <>
      <div>{counterStore.count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => counterStore.increment()}>++</button>
      <button onClick={() => counterStore.decrement()}>--</button>
    </>
  )
})

// src/components/ThemeToggler.tsx
export const ThemeToggler = observer(() => {
  const { themeStore } = useStores()

  return (
    <>
      <div>{themeStore.theme}</div>
      <button onClick={() => themeStore.setTheme('light')}>
        set theme: light
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => themeStore.setTheme('dark')}>
        set theme: dark
      </button>
    </>
  )
})

// src/App.tsx
const App = () => (
  <main>
    <Counter />
    <ThemeToggler />
  </main>
)
```
