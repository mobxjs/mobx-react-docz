# React Context

If you are using `inject` in your code, please refer to [migration guide](/recipes-migration) first or learn [why inject is considered obsolete](/recipes-inject).

[React Context][context] has replaced the [Legacy context][context-legacy] which was fairly awkward to use.

Let's make a small, but not so contrived example to show what this means for MobX.

### Create store

Let's declare a simple store. No need to worry about observables at this point, it's just a plain object.

```tsx
export type TFriend = {
  name: string
  isFavorite: boolean
  isSingle: boolean
}

export function createStore() {
  // storing variable in closure means you can access it in methods
  // otherwise you would have to use `this` which doesn't work well with TypeScript
  const store = {
    friends: [] as TFriend[]
    makeFriend(name, isFavorite = false, isSingle = false) {
      const oldFriend = store.friends.find(friend => friend.name === name)
      if (oldFriend) {
        oldFriend.isFavorite = isFavorite
        oldFriend.isSingle = isSingle
      } else {
        store.friends.push({ name, isFavorite, isSingle })
      }
    },
    get singleFriends() {
      return store.friends.filter(friend => friend.isSingle)
    },
  }
  return store
}

export type TStore = ReturnType<typeof createStore>
```

### Setup context

Nothing spectacular about it really, better to read [React docs](context) if you are unsure though.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { createStore, TStore } from './createStore'
import { useLocalStore } from 'mobx-react-lite'

const storeContext = React.createContext<TStore | null>(null)

export const StoreProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const store = useLocalStore(createStore)
  return <storeContext.Provider value={store}>{children}</storeContext.Provider>
}

export const useStore = () => {
  const store = React.useContext(storeContext)
  if (!store) {
    // this is especially useful in TypeScript so you don't need to be checking for null all the time
    throw new Error('You have forgot to use StoreProvider, shame on you.')
  }
  return store
}
```

> You could drop a whole Provider dance and set created store as a default value of the `createContext`. The reference of the store object does not need to change, so it will work in most cases. However, you might still setup a Provider for tests to battle flakiness.

### Making friends

Now somewhere in the tree we have component like this.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useStore } from '../../../store'

export const FriendsMaker = observer(() => {
  const store = useStore()
  const onSubmit = React.useCallback(({ name, favorite, single }) => {
    store.makeFriend(name, favorite, single)
  }, [])
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      Total friends: {store.friends.length}
      <input type="text" id="name" />
      <input type="checkbox" id="favorite" />
      <input type="checkbox" id="single" />
    </Form>
  )
})
```

_Explicit implementation of form logic would take up too much space and is not important for the show case._

### Listing friends

In some other part of the app we want to show friends that are single and favorite.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useStore } from '../../../../store'

export const MatchMaker = observer(() => {
  const store = useStore()
  // for a sake of example filtering is done here
  // you might as well expose it on the store directly
  const singleAndFavoriteFriends = store.singleFriends.filter(
    friend => friend.isFavorite,
  )
  return <div>{singleAndFavoriteFriends.map(renderFriend)}</div>
})
```

## Complex stores

The example above is still very contrived. Usually the app state is much more robust, but it does not differ that much in its essence. You can have a single Root store and attach every other store onto it. Or have a multiple contexts, each for own segment of the app.

Perhaps you want to consider [mobx-state-tree] for declaring store shape? It comes with other powerful features like snapshots and type safety out of box. Be sure to check it out.

The power of React hooks allows you to create specific hooks for abstracting how is the store structured, eg. `useFriendsList` or `useOrderCart`.

Such hooks are also great for mitigating long paths in bigger folder structure like seen in examples above.
