# How to manage state?

State management in React is very broad topic and new patterns are introduced very often. MobX simplifies some things, but there is still several approach to use (#ILikeOptions).

## Creating a state

The state in MobX is represented by any [observable object][observable]. You can use any of the mentioned approaches in linked document.

For advanced and more robust state the better choice might be [mobx-state-tree].

Lastly we have shiny new Hooks to help on this journey like [useLocalStore] _(not available in class components)_.

```tsx
import { observable } from 'mobx'
import { useLocalStore } from 'mobx-react-lite'

function CreatingState() {
  const simpleState = React.useRef(observable.array([1, 2, 3])).current
  const [bigState] = React.useState(createExpensiveStore)
  const localState = useLocalStore(() => ({
    count: 0,
    inc() {
      localState.count += 1
    },
  }))
  return <Rendering simple={simpleState} big={bigState} local={localStore} />
}

class CreatingState extends React.PureComponent {
  // or use constructor if class properties are not available for you
  simpleState = observable.array([1, 2, 3])
  render() {
    // class component does not support any other way of
    // keeping observable state within a component
    return <Rendering simple={this.simpleState} />
  }
}
```

> Fair warning. Don't ever use `React.useMemo` to keep reference to the state object. It can be randomly thrown away by React and you would lose data.

## Accessing a state

Second important aspect of state management is how to pass created observable around the component tree. There is no MobX related logic, but it's certainly worth mentioning here.

In simple scenarios you can create an observable locally within a component and then pass it manually through props (as shown above). It's pretty much the same approach you would use with eg. [useReducer] except you will be passing single object around only.

For a more robust state management it's recommended [to use React Context][context] over the legacy [inject].

### Global variable state?

It's possible to keep a application state in global variable that would get imported in component files and it will work in most cases.

However, if you are writing tests (you should), global variable is a problem and can cause flakiness. In short, we don't recommended keeping state in global variable.
