# State of component

**_since mobx-react-lite@1.3.0_**

```
useLocalStore<T, S>(initializer: () => T, source?: S): T
```

Local observable state can be introduced by using the `useLocalStore` hook, that runs its initializer function once to create an observable store and keeps it around for a lifetime of a component.

All properties of the returned object will be made observable automatically, getters will be turned into computed properties, and methods will be bound to the store and apply [mobx transactions][transactions] automatically. If new class instances are returned from the initializer, they will be kept as is.

> Note that using a local store might conflict with future React features like concurrent rendering.

> Note that transactions are not [actions][actions]. It is still needed to be [explicit about actions][useLocalStore and strict mode issue], if strict mode of mobx is used.

import { SmartTodo } from '../examples/SmartTodo'

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useLocalStore, useObserver } from 'mobx-react' // 6.x

export const SmartTodo = () => {
  const todo = useLocalStore(() => ({
    title: 'Click to toggle',
    done: false,
    toggle() {
      todo.done = !todo.done
    },
    get emoji() {
      return todo.done ? '😜' : '🏃'
    },
  }))

  return useObserver(() => (
    <h3 onClick={todo.toggle}>
      {todo.title} {todo.emoji}
    </h3>
  ))
}
```

<Playground>
  <SmartTodo />
</Playground>

## What about global store?

The naming `useLocalStore` was chosen to indicate that store is created locally in the component. However, that doesn't mean you cannot pass such store around the component tree. In fact it's totally possible to tackle **global state management** with `useLocalStore` despite the naming. You can for example setup bunch of _local stores_, assemble them in one root object and pass it around the app with a help of the React Context.

## Non observable dependencies

_since mobx-react-lite@1.4.0 or mobx-react@6.0_

It is important to realize that the store is created only once (_per component instance_)! It is not possible to specify dependencies to force re-creation, **nor should you directly be referring to anything non-observable in the initializer function**, as changes in those won't propagate.

The `useLocalStore` supports passing a second argument with a plain object of anything non-observable you want to be used in store derivations. It might be a value from props, `useContext` or even `useReducer` if you like to mix things up. The object you pass in the second arg should always have a same shape (no conditionals).

import { Counter, MultiplierInput } from '../examples/Counter'

<Playground>
  <MultiplierInput>
    {multiplier => <Counter multiplier={multiplier} initialCount={1} />}
  </MultiplierInput>
</Playground>

```tsx
import { observer, useLocalStore } from 'mobx-react' // 6.x

export const Counter = observer(props => {
  const store = useLocalStore(
    // don't ever destructure source, it won't work
    source => ({
      count: props.initialCount,
      get multiplied() {
        // you shouldn't ever refer to props directly here, it won't see a change
        return source.multiplier * store.count
      },
      inc() {
        store.count += 1
      },
    }),
    props, // note props passed here
  )
  return (
    <>
      <button id="inc" onClick={store.inc}>
        {`Count: ${store.count}`}
      </button>
      <span>{store.multiplied}</span>
    </>
  )
})
```

Note that internally the `useAsObservableSource` hook is used to wrap around passed object. If you don't need actions or computed properties, feel free to use that hook directly. See more [about state outsourcing](/state-outsourcing).
